        <div><Qualifications/div>
        <div>I have gotten 8 GCSE's. I have managed to get all 3 of my A-Levels. It was a bit of a struggle for me because there was no proper schooling for me before I came in here. I was used to be homeschooled so it was a great achievement for me to actually make it.
