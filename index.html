It was a bit of a struggle for me because there was no proper schooling for me before I came in here. I was used to be homeschooled so it was a great achievement for me to actually make it.</p></div>

        <div><p class="card-text">There's not a lot of things that I like to do but the ones I like I do like it to be consistent with them as much as possible. I like watching football and if the opportunity arises, like to play it as well. I have started running, I am not the most consistent but I am still doing it however many times I can do it. If the conversation can flow nicely, I am the type of person who will chat with the other person hours on end.</p></div>
